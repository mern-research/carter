# napier 
Napier is an extensive and comprehensive high performance mathematics library written in C++
it includes operations and functions for a plethora of different mathematical disciplines
in different areas such as engineering, physics, computer graphics, visualisation, data science,
machine learning, financial mathematics and more.

Napier aims to minimise resource usage such a memory and resource usage
employing advanced algorithms and data structures in order to achieve sub second
execution speeds with even the largest inputs. Napier offers support for parallel 
processing allowing computations to be split into multiple threads or processes 
to run concurrently.
